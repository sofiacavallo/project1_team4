Our project is to uncover patterns in global warming over time. We’ll examine relationships between average global temperatures and CO2 emissions, CO2 emissions and industrialization activity, and related questions. (Data sources: weather data, CO2 emissions data.)

Questions we want to answer:
Is there a correlation between rise in global average temperatures and CO2 emissions?
Are CO2 emissions tied to industrialization/human activity?
To figure this out, might need to look at CO2 emissions by country
What will the average global temperature be in year X?
